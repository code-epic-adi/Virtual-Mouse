# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse using Hand Tracking  

A **gesture-controlled virtual mouse** using **MediaPipe and OpenCV**, enabling touchless interaction by tracking hand movements and gestures in real time.<br><br>  

## ✨ Features<br>
✅ **Hand Tracking** – Uses **MediaPipe** to detect hand landmarks.<br>  
✅ **Cursor Control** – Moves the mouse pointer based on **index finger** position.  <br>
✅ **Gesture-Based Clicking** – Pinch to click, two-finger scroll for navigation.  <br>
✅ **Smooth Performance** – Dynamic smoothing for precise movement.  <br>
✅ **Screen Mapping** – Converts finger position to screen coordinates. <br> <br>

## 📌 Technologies Used  <br>
- **Python**  <br>
- **OpenCV**  <br>
- **MediaPipe**  <br>
- **NumPy**  <br>
- **AutoPy**  <br><br>

## 🎯 How It Works<br>
- Move your index finger to control the cursor.<br>
- Pinch gesture (index + thumb) for left-click.<br>
- Two-finger gesture for scrolling.<br><br>

## Use Cases for Integration 🚀<<br>
🔹 Accessibility & Assistive Tech – Enables hands-free computer control for individuals with motor impairments.<br>
🔹 Smart Home & IoT – Gesture-based navigation for smart TVs, IoT devices, and automation systems.<br>
🔹 Gaming & VR/AR – Enhances interaction in virtual reality and gaming applications.<br>
🔹 Public Kiosks & Contactless Systems – Reduces physical contact in ATMs, airport check-ins, and self-service kiosks.<br>
